Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer:
1 -> imports everything from the TurtleWorld module; modules are on the PYTHONPATH
2 -> create an instance of the TurtleWorld object and assigns it to world
3 -> create an instance of Turtle object and assigns it to bob
4 -> wait_for_user() tells TurtleWorld to wait for a the user to do something


These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

Answer:

Answer:

-- What is this type of requirement called?
